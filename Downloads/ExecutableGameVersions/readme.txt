These .zip files contain the game as a single executable file and are fully runnable after extraction.

From my experience the game also runs with a playable framerate on newer versions of wine for linux users, but might have problems with sounds not playing in rapid succession or at all.


Zip information below.

nobundle:
This version of the game needs to find an installed jre (1.8.0_25 or newer) from your computer to run.
Should work in normal cases for people who keep java updated.

onlybundle:
This version of the game is bundled together with the jre it uses to run and doesn't accept anything else.
The folder containing game.exe can be moved around freely, but don't change the path of anything inside it.
Use a shortcut of game.exe if you want to launch it from elsewhere.
Use this zip if you don't have java installed, an old or corrupt version of it or a hidden installation the game can't find on its own.
If you have no idea what you're doing, this or 'both' is probably your best bet.

both:
This version of the game first searches for an accepted jre to run and falls back on a bundled version if it fails.
